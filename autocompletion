It's the shell that provides auto-completion. In bash's case, there's a command 
called complete that's used to tell it what to do when tab-complete is called for. 
So if you have tab completion enabled for terraform, you should 
be able to do complete -p to list out all of the auto-completions set up in your 
current shell environment. Find "terraform" in that list:

complete -p | grep terraform
When I do that, it says this:

complete -F _minimal terraform
So now to set up your alias command to have the same auto-completion function, you'd run that same command for it:

complete -F _minimal tfm
Run that and try tab-completion on tfm. And, obviously, to run that same command every time you 
login to your shell, put it in your shell's startup file. (.bashrc for bash)

There are situations where this might not work, if the auto-completion function is 
funky and checks the actual command run. But I've never personally had that issue. It's always worked for me.
